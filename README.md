I have also been working on my own Audiobook side project for past few months. I am in process of content curation in order to build my own CMS with Firebase. I have more than 5 million audio content (about 20% is popular/usable) available to me in more than 100 languages, all free. I am clearly interested in the potential of audiobooks.
