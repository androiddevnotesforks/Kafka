## Architecture

This app focuses on scalable, flexible and reactive app architecure. Parts of the architecture are inspired by Chris Banes' [Tivi app](https://github.com/chrisbanes/tivi).

It is a version of MVVM with interactors as an additional layer to enhance re-usability. The app uses following frameworks


* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) (throughout the data layer; for thread switching)
* Jetpack compose
* [Livedata](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) (between ViewModels and Fragments)
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)
* [Paging Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/) (for pagination and integration with room)
* Retrofit2
* [Klint](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint) (code formatter for Kotlin)
* [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer) - For audio playback
